* Create symbolic links in MS Windows
To create symbolic links for each setup-file in a target directory, execute the
following command in a PowerShell, which has been started as Administrator:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
foreach ($file in Get-ChildItem PROJECT_DIR\setup-*.* | Where-Object { ! ($_.Name -match ".
~") }) { $fname = $file.Name; New-Item -Path TARGET_DIR\$fname -ItemType SymbolicLink -Value $file -Force}
#+END_SRC
